Paragraph 4:   Analyze   the article (55 pts: 10pts for appropriate use of each concept, 35 points for overall analysis)
·   Succinctly analyze the news article you chose.
·   Use both concepts to support your analysis.
·   You can use a concept to offer further clarification of what the article is saying or as a means to critique what the article is saying.
·   Remember - you are using the concepts to analyze the article rather than using parts of the article to describe the concepts.·   If there are parts of the article that contradict the main analysis you are making using your concepts, be sure to address this in some way.
·   Make sure that your analysis is geographic - keep the importance of place, spatial relations, scalar analysis and/or networks in mind.
Paragraph 5:   Reflect   (15 pts)
·   Critically reflect on the example and your concepts. Where do you see power at play?
·   Possible questions to guide your reflection: What perspective was taken by the author of the article? What other perspectives might there be? Who would theses various perspectives benefit and/or exclude. What other questions could be asked or perspectives taken that would change the interpretation of this situation? What additional information would you need to craft a more informed understanding of the power relations related to this situation?
·   Note: if you use questions in this section, be sure to include the thought process that led you to that question in order to gain more points.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONNote:   Late assignments will be subject to a late penalty of 10% per day (including weekends) of the total marks for the assignment. Assignments submitted five calendar days beyond the due date will be assigned a grade of zero.   Note: You have the option of completing this assignment with a partner – but ONLY if that partner is in your tutorial. If you do partner, BOTH people need to submit and BOTH people need to write each others’ name in the comments section of the assignment submission page.Note on Citations: If you draw upon general ideas from class or put concepts in your own words, you do not need to cite them. However, if you draw on a specific phrase or a specific example from either the readings or the lecture videos, then you do need to cite them for reasons of academic integrity. A bibliography of the major sources used in the Readers is available at the end of each reader. I will accept any of the major citation styles: APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.
